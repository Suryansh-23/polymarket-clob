echo "           Multi-Fill Order Matching Enhancement - COMPLETE"
echo "============================================================================="
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:"
echo ""

echo "1. üìà Multi-Fill Batch Processing"
echo "   - Enhanced MatchAndBatch signature with maxBatch parameter"
echo "   - Supports up to 100 fills per batch (configurable)"
echo "   - Processes all crossable orders in single batch"
echo ""

echo "2. üîÑ Partial Order Fills"
echo "   - Orders can be partially filled across multiple batches"
echo "   - Remaining amounts are calculated and preserved"
echo "   - Fully filled orders are removed from orderbook"
echo ""

echo "3. üìä Bid/Ask Order Classification"
echo "   - Automatic determination of order side (bid vs ask)"
echo "   - Proper separation for cross-price matching"
echo "   - Price-time priority within each side"
echo ""

echo "4. üßÆ Enhanced Order Book Pruning"
echo "   - Smart removal of fully filled orders"
echo "   - Preservation of partially filled orders with updated amounts"
echo "   - Efficient orderbook state management"
echo ""

echo "5. üèóÔ∏è Improved Algorithm Structure"
echo "   - sortOrders(): Price-time priority sorting"
echo "   - splitBidsAsks(): Bid/ask separation"
echo "   - parseAmount()/formatAmount(): Safe amount handling"
echo "   - copyOrder(): Deep order copying"
echo ""

echo "üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS:"
echo ""

echo "Enhanced MatchAndBatch Function:"
echo "```go"
echo "func MatchAndBatch(orders []Order, maxBatch int) (string, []byte, []Order, error)"
echo "```"
echo ""

echo "Key Improvements:"
echo "- Multi-fill loop processes all crossable orders"
echo "- Floating-point epsilon handling for partial fills"
echo "- Comprehensive logging for debugging"
echo "- Proper error handling and validation"
echo ""

echo "Order Struct Enhancement:"
echo "- Added IsBid field for order classification"
echo "- Automatic side determination in main.go"
echo "- Compatible with existing EIP-712 structure"
echo ""

echo "üìã INTEGRATION POINTS:"
echo ""

echo "Main.go Integration:"
echo "```go"
echo "mu.Lock()"
echo "root, fillsBytes, updatedBook, err := matcher.MatchAndBatch(orderBook, 100)"
echo "orderBook = updatedBook"
echo "mu.Unlock()"
echo "```"
echo ""

echo "üß™ TESTING:"
echo ""

echo "Available Test Scripts:"
echo "- test_matcher.go: Direct unit testing of matching logic"
echo "- test_multifill.sh: HTTP API testing with multiple orders"
echo "- Enhanced logging for production debugging"
echo ""

echo "Example Test Scenario:"
echo "Orders: 1000@0.60 (bid), 500@0.50 (ask), 800@0.55 (bid)"
echo "Result: 500 units filled, remaining: 500@0.60 (bid), 800@0.55 (bid)"
echo ""

echo "üéØ PRODUCTION READINESS:"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Thread-safe orderbook management with mutex"
echo "‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and validation"
echo "‚úÖ Configurable batch size limits"
echo "‚úÖ Efficient memory management with order copying"
echo "‚úÖ Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging"
echo "‚úÖ Backward-compatible API structure"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ NEXT STEPS:"
echo ""

echo "Ready for:"
echo "- Error handling and retry mechanisms"
echo "- Advanced order types (limit, market, stop)"
echo "- Real-time market data integration"
echo "- Performance optimization for high-frequency trading"
echo "- Integration with EigenLayer operator infrastructure"
